# CodeAlpha_CGPA
A simple C++ console program that calculates GPA and CGPA based on user-input grades and credit hours for multiple courses. It computes total grade points, total credit hours, and outputs the final GPA/CGPA. No arrays or advanced data structuresâ€”just a clean beginner-level implementation.
